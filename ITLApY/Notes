outData is just a pointer — it holds the address of your data (your array).
It doesn’t hold the actual data itself.

It just knows where the data lives in memory.

| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Initialization                | How objects and members are set up                |
| OOP (classes, inheritance)    | Organizing code via types and hierarchies         |
| Polymorphism / Virtual funcs  | Dynamic behavior via base pointers/references     |
| Templates                     | Generic programming & compile-time polymorphism   |
| Concepts (C++20)              | Constraints for safer template use                |
| References vs Pointers        | Aliasing vs address-based access                  |
| Operator Overloading          | Custom behavior using standard operators          |
| Exceptions                    | Structured runtime error handling                 |
| Smart Pointers & RAII         | Safe resource and memory management               |
| Advanced Features (RTTI, TMP) | Type introspection and complex compile-time logic |
